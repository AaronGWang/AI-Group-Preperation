# AI Group Preperation
Here you will find information regarding the application and information to aid you in completing the creative projects.

***NOTE: This page does not include specific information about what the application is, instead it is used to prepare you for the application as a reward for joining the group early.***


## Agenda
Most resources in this page is video, viewers are recommended to work through all provided resources on this page before the official publication of applications (November 15th). 

We do not recommend viewers to continue past this pathway too much, as there will be more learning and resources planned for the future.
